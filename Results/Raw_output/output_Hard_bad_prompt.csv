Robot Selector:
Robot21 cannot solve the task with the tool property: lawnmower because the task requires a gripper to remove the toolkit, and a lawnmower is not suitable for this purpose. The lawnmower is designed for cutting grass and cannot be used to grip or remove objects. Therefore, Robot21 with a lawnmower is not capable of completing the task of removing the toolkit.

Robot Selector:
Robot23, equipped with a tow hook, has been selected to move to location (7, 5) and remove the vehicle. Robot13 does not have a tow hook and therefore cannot perform the task of removing the vehicle. The initial tool selected for Robot13 was a gripper, which is not suitable for towing vehicles. As such, Robot13 cannot solve the task with the tool property of a tow hook, as it does not possess this tool.

Robot Selector:
Robot22 has been selected to solve the task with its gripper tool property. Although Robot22 does not have a tow hook, it can still manage to remove the construction materials using its gripper. The gripper is capable of grasping and lifting various objects, which should be sufficient for clearing the construction materials at the specified location. Therefore, Robot22 can solve the task with the tool property: gripper.

response: Selecting the appropriate robot to move to location (11, 2) and remove the tree branches.

Robot Selector:
Robot24 has been selected and is equipped with a saw to remove the tree branches at location (11, 2). Robot9, however, does not have a tow hook, which was the initially selected tool for moving to the location. Instead, Robot9 has a front loader. 

Given the task at hand, Robot9 with a front loader is not suitable for removing tree branches, as a front loader is typically used for moving loose materials like soil or sand rather than for towing or precise branch removal. Therefore, Robot9 cannot solve the task with the tool property of a front loader.
---
Supervisor:
Next: Robot_selector
response: Robot9 is not suitable for the task with its current tool. We need to select a different robot that is equipped with the appropriate tool for removing tree branches.
