Robot Selector:
The initial selected tool for the task of removing the toolkit was ""gripper,"" as this is the appropriate tool for picking up items such as a toolkit. Robot40 is equipped with a ""vacuum,"" which is not suitable for this task because vacuums are designed for collecting dust and small debris, not for manipulating solid objects like a toolkit. Therefore, Robot40 with a vacuum cannot solve the task of removing a toolkit. We need to select a different robot with a gripper to accomplish this task.
---
Supervisor:
Next: Robot_selector
