Robot Selector:
Thought process:
- Identified that the task involves removing construction materials.
- Selected the gripper tool property as it is suitable for handling construction materials.
- Used the robot selection tool to find the most suitable robot with a gripper near the specified location.
- Robot42 was identified as the best-suited robot for the task.
- Selected Robot42 for the task using the select known robot tool.

Results:
- Robot42, equipped with a gripper, has been selected to move to location (11, 2) and remove the construction materials.
---
Supervisor:
Next: Controller
response: Robot42 has been selected and now the Controller needs to command Robot42 to move to the specified location and perform the task.

Controller:
Thought process:
- Received the task to move a robot to a specific location and remove construction materials.
- Selected Robot42 with a gripper tool property as it is suitable for handling construction materials.
- Used the move_robot function to move Robot42 to the specified location (11, 2).
- After moving, used the grab_or_remove_item function to remove the construction materials.
- Set Robot42's status to idle using the robot_status_change function to indicate the completion of the task.

Results:
- Robot42 was successfully moved to location (11, 2).
- Construction materials at the location were successfully removed.

Move Robot2 to location (1, 10) and remove the tree branches.;"Supervisor:
Next: Robot_selector
response: Select a robot capable of moving to location (1, 10) and removing tree branches.
---
Robot Selector:
Initial selected tool: saw
Reason Robot2 can't solve the task with the tool property: gripper: The task requires removing tree branches, which is specifically associated with the tool property ""saw"" according to the provided list of items with associated tool properties. The gripper tool is not suitable for cutting or removing tree branches. Therefore, Robot2 with a gripper cannot complete the task as required.
---
Supervisor:
Next: Robot_selector
response: Robot2 is not suitable for the task due to its gripper tool. We need to select a different robot equipped with a saw to remove the tree branches.
---
Robot Selector:
Thought process:
- Identified that the task requires removing tree branches, which necessitates the use of a saw.
- Since Robot2 was initially selected but has a gripper, which is not suitable for the task, I needed to find a robot with a saw.
- Used the robot_selection_tool function to find the most suitable robot with a saw near the location (1, 10).

Results:
- Robot14 has been selected as the best-suited robot to remove the tree branches at location (1, 10) because it is equipped with a saw.
---
Supervisor:
Next: Controller
response: Robot14 has been selected and needs to be moved to the location (1, 10) to remove the tree branches.

Thought process:
- Identified the task of removing tree branches, which requires a saw.
- Selected Robot14, which is equipped with a saw, to perform the task.
- Moved Robot14 to the specified location (1, 10).
- Used Robot14 to grab/remove the tree branches.
- Set Robot14's status to idle after completing the task.

Results:
- Robot14 successfully moved to location (1, 10).
- Tree branches at location (1, 10) were successfully removed by Robot14.
- Robot14's status is now set to idle.
