Move to location (3, 3) and remove the toolkit.;"Supervisor:
Next: Robot_selector
response: Select a robot that can move to location (3, 3) and remove the toolkit.

Robot Selector:
Thought process:
- Identified the need for a gripper tool to remove the toolkit.
- Used the robot_selection_tool to find the best-suited robots with a gripper tool.
- Positioned the toolkit at coordinates (3, 3).

Results:
- Robot2 was selected as the best-suited robot to perform the task with its gripper tool.
---
Supervisor:
Next: Controller
response: The Robot_selector has identified Robot2 with a gripper tool as suitable for the task. Now, the Controller needs to command Robot2 to move to location (3, 3) and remove the toolkit.
---
Controller:
Thought process:
- Identified the task to move the robot to a specific location and remove an item.
- Used the `move_robot` function to position the robot at (3, 3).
- Used the `grab_or_remove_item` function to remove the toolkit.
- Set the robot's status to idle after completing the task using the `robot_status_change` function.

Results:
- Robot2 successfully moved to the location (3, 3).
- The toolkit was successfully removed by Robot2.
- Robot2's status is now set to idle.

Move to location (9, 5) and remove the liquid spill.;"Supervisor:
Next: Robot_selector
response: Select a robot that can navigate to the location and clean up the liquid spill.

Robot Selector:
Thought process:
- Identified the task as cleaning a liquid spill, which requires a mop.
- Used the robot selection tool to find robots with a mop tool property and close to the specified location.

Results:
- Selected Robot6 as the best-suited robot to remove the liquid spill at location (9, 5).
---
Supervisor:
Next: Controller
response: Robot6 has been selected to perform the task. The Controller will now direct Robot6 to move to location (9, 5) and remove the liquid spill.

Controller:
Thought process:
- I identified the need to clean a liquid spill, which usually requires a mop.
- I used the move_robot function to move Robot6, which has a mop tool, to the location (9, 5).
- Then, I used the grab_or_remove_item function to command Robot6 to remove the liquid spill.
- Finally, I changed the status of Robot6 to idle using the robot_status_change function.

Results:
- Robot6 was successfully moved to location (9, 5).
- Robot6 removed the liquid spill at the location.
- Robot6's status has been set to idle after completing the task.

Robot Selector:
Thought process:
- Identified the task required a robot capable of removing large debris.
- Recognized that a gripper tool would be suitable for picking up and removing debris.
- Used the robot_selection_tool function to find the best-suited robot with a gripper tool property for the task location (3, 4).

Results:
- Robot2 is selected as the best-suited robot to remove the large debris at location (3, 4) with its gripper tool.
---
Supervisor:
Next: Controller
response: Robot2 has been selected for the task. Controller will now direct Robot2 to move to location (3, 4) and remove the large debris.

Controller:
Thought process:
- Required to move a robot to a specified location and remove an item.
- Moved the robot (Robot2) with the appropriate tool (gripper) to the location (3, 4).
- Used the robot to grab/remove the large debris at the location.
- Set the robot's status to idle once the task was completed.

Results:
- Robot2 successfully moved to location (3, 4).
- Robot2 removed the large debris.
- Robot2 status set to idle after completion of the task.
